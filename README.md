# Keras LSTM Boilerplate

This project builds on the [Keras LSTM text generation example](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py). I'm using it to teach myself about machine learning, Keras and LSTM networks. The code should be fairly self-explanatory, and I've documented it to provide additional guidance. This includes many "to learns" that you can ignore, as they're there to guide my self-education. 

To use this, provide a text document to use as the input, and update values in index.py. The application will generate a new model if needed and then use the model to generate outputs. You can tweak values in index.py to see how they affect the outputs. Feedback, improvements and assistance with documentation welcome!
