After using Siri and seeing other trends, I think we're moving from a web culture that emphasizes SEARCH to one where tools/services FIND.

City Council Scorecard: How to save the Port Lands http://t.co/2QLIrbx -- make sure your councillor knows your opinion
@jaimestein Perhaps more importantly, where is the public consultation? Current plan took years of consultation. New one unilateral.
@jaimestein Agreed. Existing plan is balanced, including homes and retail. New .lan.only talks about malls, hotels, ferris wheels so far.
We apparently can't stop Dictator Doug from foisting his fantasy on us. But council can stand up for us. Hold them accountable.
So its priorities are skewed: amusements for tourists instead of homes for citizens; malls for shopping instead of natural environments.
The existing, award-winning plan involved years of public consultation. Doug Ford's? Nobody heard of it until now.
And who gave him the right? We didn't elect Doug Ford mayor, and he's not the councillor for a waterfront ward.
Ford's plan sees one-time pennies for selling land, not recurring dollars for residential property taxes. Result:  higher taxes in future.
If Ford's plan is approved, we'll need to restart a multi-year environmental assessment that previously cost $19 million. You'll pay for it.
Some key points: Ford hired an architect to revamp a plan approved by council without any oversight. That cost you money.
Doug Ford presents his expensive, irrational, undemocratic fantasy for Toronto's waterfront to committee today. Hold them accountable.

How much of their lunacy will we take? We must stand up to this, or live in a city with a Frankenstein waterfront and no libraries.
And by the way, there is a plan, contrary to the Fords' ignorance: http://t.co/FvAqzwl.
The Fords are selling this city's future--our children's future--for short-term gain, throwing away a plan that citizens shaped.
Want ferris wheels for tourists or houses for citizens? Want a monorail for novelty or an integrated transit plan for usefulness?
Financial: want a short-term cash infusion from selling land, or long-term windfall from property taxes on new homes?
Social and cultural: do you want big box stores on the waterfront, or parks? Environmental: want a renaturalized river, or parking lots?
Still livid about the Ford waterfront fantasy: socially, culturally, environmentally and--shockingly--FINANCIALLY worse than current plan.
The Fords have a terrible, no-good, very bad plan for Torontoâ€™s Port Lands http://t.co/1O5K7r3 -- rise up, Toronto, let's fight back

Kim now talking about aggregation and curation. Another key trend, I believe. Here's why: http://t.co/KoIhldw. #mcbod
And speaking of sponsorships, here's recent data on their growth for digital publishers: http://t.co/3iRTPfw #mcbod note: @magscanada
One thing that's coming up often, but not being tackled directly: sponsorships are growing in importance. #mcbod
Kim Machado back up, talking about examples of digital publishing innovation in North America. #mcbod
@CG_OF_EC Become a celebrity and then go batshit crazy :) Or check slides here: www.slideshare.net/KimPittaway
Now up, @markevans on the impact of social sharing on search. #mcbod
@kimpittaway: .witter is your wider circle, Facebook is your inner circle..Agree. #mcbod
@kimpittaway: emotion = distribution on social media. Agree, and stats suggest that--wow!--it works. #mcbod
However, LOADS of issues. Including major price cut to $13, $7.50 of which goes to magazine. Verdict still out. #mcbod
Key to success was getting Facebook and Twitter followers to promote it. #mcbod
This Magazine tried selling subscriptions through Groupon. Result: 286 subscribers. Better than any direct response campaign. #mcbod
@kimpittaway now talking about social media as it applies to magazines. Mags are good at building communities offline. Online? #mcbod
Advertisers and publishers converging on content marketing. Kim Machado showing examples of mags using web content to sell product. #mcbod
At @rightspotmedia, we work with both. For many reasons (there's a blog post in here...) advertisers are typically way ahead. #mcbod
One high-level, possible controversial observation: advertiser are generally way more digitally savvy than publishers. #mcbod
Stats suggest mobile magazine site access mainly 5-7 PM, weekends, early mornings. 1% to 15% of mag site traffic is mobile. #mcbod
There's a move to larger ad formats, fewer ads and less clutter (10% less over last 14 months). Means more brand ads and higher CPM. #mcbod
Overall social media use still growing, but are kids increasingly finding it uncool? If so, what might they turn to next? #mcbod
Social media use is actually shrinking in the 2-24 age bracket, with 18% fewer visits for 2-17 in Q4 2010 year over year. #mcbod
Some of the top ads in January 2011 in Canada had an average frequency of 27+...excessive? #mcbod
Teen community (read: magazine) sites also up 32% year-over-year in Canada. #mcbod
Top-growing .ommunity.content online in Canada: food, beauty/fashion/style, home. #mcbod

Also, lawsuits can backfire and lead to expansion of fair use that protects bloggers and others who are .tealing.content.
Not the only solution. But better than lawsuits that lead to (a) loss of public sympathy and (b) decreased traffic and revenue.
Key is monetization and protecting brand. Creative Commons content + embedded sponsorship + facilitated distribution.
Monetized distribution will always beat centralization because there are more external distribution points--no matter how big the publisher.
I see publishers being successful by getting content distributed and embedding demarcated sponsorships within that content, for example.
Yes, journalism and journalists needs revenue, and copyright can help. But BARRIERS to distribution go against the fabric of the Internet.

For this reason, one key metric advertisers may become interested in is .nfluence.-a publisher's ability to get distribution.
Another example: Embedding ads directly within a content item, then getting that item widely distributed through RSS, etc.
Example: Mashable gets editorial sponsored, and sponsorship messages get embedded in posts distributed through RSS.
Distributed monetization refers to increasing trend of publishers leveraging digital distribution channels for off-site audience reach.
Where's digital publishing going? From my perspective, key trends are aggregation, curation, personalization and distributed monetization.

So: (1) create awesome content; (2) make it easy to aggregate; (3) get it sponsored; (4) embed sponsorship message; (5) distribute.
Mashable, for example, does this well, with editorial features sponsored--but not controlled--by advertisers. Distributed by RSS.
My sense: create content for distribution, embed advertising (identified as such) within, and give it away.
Clear that aggregation and curation are  trends to watch. So how can content creators make money?
Why? For the same reason people love Pandora: personalization + discovery.
This feels to me like the future of content consumption. Not single publications like a New York Times app.

That is all. Perhaps it's time to start blogging again, rather than microblogging an essay.
Just because two things are on the internet doesn't mean they're anything alike. Big brands can't expand to encompass every new idea.
I'm sure Google (and others) would laugh if Facebook planned to launch a search engine. But they're planning to launch a social network?
People often think a strong brand can be extended to anything. Not true. Extending brands often dilutes them.
Google's mission is supposedly to organize the world's information, but it's hard to see how that applies to Google Offers.
Google Offers will be the Bud Light Lime of the group-discount space, and only dilute Google's core search brand.
I think what we've seen over the years is that the law of line extension applies to internet brands.

Done The Facebook Effect. Verdict: Great company history, but too one-sided. Consider it embedded journalism, and be as wary as with war.
Why embedded? Author Kirkpatrick got exclusive access to Zuckerberg et. al. Zuck encouraged him to write the book.
That doesn't diminish the reporting and writing. It's a well-written book with deep (if sometimes slightly inaccurate) research.
What's lacking is balance. At least one entire chapter interviewing critics and rivals--on issues like lawsuits, privacy--would be good.
Sense (supported by postscript) is that Facebook made things so easy for Kirkpatrick to get THEIR story, he didn't work enough for critics'.
Bottom line: Read the book as if it's an authorized company history, then wait for more balanced books to follow.

Check out @rachelbotsman, .n a mission to making sharing cool,.researched and written book. See http://bit.ly/bqFofw
One of many key points from @rachelbotsman: reputational capital is the new credit score, because sharing's built on trust--not money.
@timfalconer Thanks for the RT. Was thinking of you writing that because car ownership is the coal mine canary of this trend.
Reputation also key to getting attention in an attention-scarce world. Social capital is of increasing importance.
If sharing is the new ownership (and I think it is), reputational capital is the new financial capital--trust is the new money. #CollCon

Perhaps the scariest part about the oil spill and recent financial collapse is the extent we can now create problems we can't easily solve.
We do less prevention because we think we can solve big problems--disappearing honeybees, global warming. But we can't plug a leaking well.

Picked up and started reading Dan Ariely's *Predictably Irrational*. Excellent. Saw Ariely speak at Burning Man last year, of all places.
Takeaway #1: Price is largely arbitrary and price anchors can be set arbitrarily. But it's relative, and the first anchor endures.
Example: We used to think coffee cost $1. That anchor endures. So Starbucks created new anchors--it's not a large coffee, it's a vente bold.
And those anchors become our own social proof. Like @RobertCialdini notes, we become consistent. We paid $4 for coffee once, we will again.
Lots of overlap with @chr1sa's Free in @danariely's Predictably Irrational. But the latter delves more into free and social norms.
For example, studies show that people will work harder for nothin' than for pay, under the right social conditions. With better output!
Social norms and market norms don't mix. You might not be able to afford my services, but in the right circumstances, I'll give them away.
Just thinking of money makes us market-oriented and subverts social norms. Hunch: social tech is shifting us more towards social norms.

Early days, but my gut feeling about the iPad is that it will cannibalize print sales but only marginally increase publisher revenue.
This said, I think the shift away from print to slates will offer new revenue opportunities for innovative publishers.
One idea I'd like to see: publishers giving away iPads free with sizable subscription contracts, like cell phone companies.
Like: .ubscribe to The Globe and Mail iPad edition for three years and get a free iPad..Perhaps an initial loss but a long-term gain.
Companies like Rogers with publishing and wireless arms could offer data and magazine subscription contract bundles with a .ree.iPad.

Facebook's web-domination will surely precede web-wide social ads. How will they share revenue? This is real competitor to AdWords/AdSense.

Facebook will soon let you .ike.any website and log you in automatically to Connect on some sites. Why? Theory: Ad network.
Google makes a ton of money on its AdSense network. Facebook could launch a similar network if it expanded it's reach beyond facebook.com.
I predict we'll see such a network soon. You'll go to a site, get auto-logged in, and see Facebook ads tailored to your profile.
The site you're on will get a percentage of ad revenue. Will it work? Possibly better than the ads work on Facebook itself.
But execution is key. Google and Facebook will converge with ads intersecting context (websites) and users (profiles). A battle looms.

Life and business are marathons, not sprints. Long-term success takes deep thinking, not just doing. Your mind needs space to breathe.
Checking email (and stuff like email, e.g. Facebook) is probably the worst offender. Do you own your inbox, or does it own you?
Multi-tasking destroys effectiveness (experience and studies prove it). Single-tasking is the solution, but takes courage--and planning.
Currently try to check email just twice/day, as promoted by many, like @tferriss. Benefits include seeing PATTERNS lost in rapid response.
Hardest part of single-tasking / email control is fear of missing something big. It's a mind game. Takes time. But the rewards reinforce.
Focus should be effectiveness--ROI. Every minute is precious and must account for its expenditure.

37 Signals has new book out, Rework. One to read. Added to the list. @ttwala take note!
Finally reading Innovator's Dilemma. Excellent analysis of market disruption. (I know, late read on this one.)
Great quote - Innovator's Dilemma: .D]ifferentiation loses its meaning when the features and functionality exceed what the market demands.
Meaning: Just because your offering is different from competitors', doesn't mean customers care about the difference more than price.
Model: Functionality &gt; reliability &gt; convenience &gt; price. Happens again and again, industry after industry.
Disruptive offerings tend to be simpler, cheaper, more reliable and more convenient than established offerings. Small biz? Focus on those.
Illusively obvious: Want to be disruptive? Find bloated offerings with functionality few customers use, offer something simpler and cheaper.
That's the basic strategy of small, successful, profitable companies like 37 Signals (15 people, over 3 million customers).

Will the iPad .ave.journalism? As a former journalist who now consults with publishers in the digital space, my gut says no.
First, history shows that the web wins. Whatever walled gardens get built will likely be torn down or made obsolete by open web platforms.
Second, while people might pay a few bucks for an e-book or digital album, there's no indication they'd pay for an e-magazine subscription.
With the existence of Wikipedia, can we foresee a day when people will overwhelmingly pay for a digital encyclopedia? Even on the iPad?
As long as the web stays open, content will be mostly free, monetized by new models, some of which may be facilitated by tech like iPad.
But fundamentally, it's the web itself that will have the biggest impact on publishers. Far more people listen to MP3s than have iTunes.
So, for what it's worth, I think the iPad's cool. But it's just a delivery platform.
And if anything, it just adds to publishers' digital challenges. In addition to the web, there are now various digital reader platforms.
So even if the iPad proves helpful, figuring how to use it with the mix of other digital channels will be a challenge--hopefully a fun one.

Alan Sochan of Indielove.ca at #tedxgta: Our media doesn't reflect our culture. Why does 75% of our media come from somewhere else?
Sochan at #tedxgta: It's not like Canadians don't produce this commodity--we make great music. So why do we import so much?
So far, #tedxgta has been far more local and political than #Ted proper. Talks have addressed gov't regulation of telecomm and radio play.
In fact, while I'm excited about #tedxgta and its future, so far there's been too much self-promotion and too little substance.
Alan Cross of Edge fame at #tedxgta talking about the .low-motion.music revolution.
Alan Cross at #tedxgta: smart phones making music more mobile; bigger and bigger push to get people downloading music to mobile devices.
Alan Cross at #tedxgta: second part of revolution is access versus possession. Transition from owning music to .enting,.e.g. Spotify.
Alan Cross at #tedxgta: part three of revolution is .ise of the curators..With abundant music comes scarce attention. What to listen to?
Alan Cross at #tedxgta: part four of revolution is decline of sound. We care less and less about fidelity. Ears don't know, but brain does.
Cross suggests at #tedxgta that the brain produces less dopamine in response to MP3s than to analog recordings. Show me the reference.
Alan Cross at #tedxgta: fifth part of revolution is rise of independent artists who mix a bit of business with a bit of music.
Alan Cross at #tedxgta: Canadians are getting left behind with tech, e.g. no Kindle, no Pandora, no Spotify, high charge for wireless.
Alan Cross at #tedxgta: .usic is going to flow like water..Will be like a utility. But first we must change Canadian regulations.

Somewhere out there must be a directory of .ree,.linking to everything that's available free, and where to find it. Anyone have a link?
Finished *Free*. Excellent. Bottom line: Free will only grow. Run with it, but find the scarcity to sell against your abundance.
Bertrand Competition: .n a competitive market, price falls to the marginal cost,.Anderson notes. And the web's damn competitive.
Every abundance creates a new scarcity. . wealth of information creates a poverty of attention..- Herbert Simon...in 1972!
In the .ree.market, the .ttention economy.and the .eputation economy.become more important--that's where the scarcity lies.
Anderson: Google is the central bank of the attention and reputation economies, as it converts that capital into visibility with PageRank.
You can therefore think of internet marketing as follows: build reputational capital, convert it to attention, convert that to money.
Are you making the mistake of confusing abundancies and scarcities? The most scarce thing is your TIME. Hesitate to waste that above all.
In our (rightfully) eco-conscious world, we loathe waste. But SOME waste--e.g. experimentation--is required to find .lobal maxima..*Free*

Interesting insight from Free: Over the lifetime of a Google server, the energy it consumes costs more than the hardware.
Solution: Make energy prices decline as fast as computer hardware prices. Hence Google's interest in solar.
*Free* refines understanding of Google. It grows as web content and use grow OVERALL. E.g. YouTube needn't profit, just foster web growth.
Anderson: Free is for people with more time than money. Paid for people with more money than time.
Anderson: Where the ratio of thought to stuff is high, and the innovations frequent, cost drives relentlessly to nothing.
Anderson: .bundant information wants to be free. Scarce information wants to be expensive.

Similarly, while I worry about stagnant buying power, clearly we have growing access to luxuries kings never dreamed--increasingly free.

The freeconomy isn't just an online phenomenon. Seeing increasing out-of-home product sampling--such as for Fuze today.
Rather, blockbusters result from economic scarcity--when you only have a few screens in a theater, you NEED blockbusters. Ditto elsewhere.
Reading The Long Tail, I see tail everywhere. Starbucks is the long tail of coffee--there are apparently 19,000 beverage variations.
That said, the Long Tail shouldn't be an invitation to line-extend, which is notoriously bad (I'm talking to you, Bud Light Lime).

Could we believe in our increasingly abstract economic systems without the capacity for self- and shared delusion?

More interesting happiness news today on CBC Radio's The Current: Women aren't any happier today than 30 years ago, despite many gains.
Decline in women's happiness is across the board--all ages and stages. Obvious things like .upermom.syndrom don't appear responsible.
But interesting trend: women are increasingly concerned about SUCCESS in multiple areas of life but say what's missing is MEANING and FUN.
Men may have benefitted more from women's movement (at least in regard to happiness). For example, less burden to be sole breadwinner.
Also worth noting that men, as well as women, benefitted from birth control pill due to the wider availability of sex outside marriage.

A big problem with traditional media companies' use of the internet is their focus on centralization. The web is inherently decentralized.
The key to traditional media success online is embracing decentralization. E.g. post unique content that gets links--not wire stories.

Another factor newspapers don't seem to get about the web: it's inherently niche-focused, not general interest.
Offline, you can print similar stories to other papers cuz readers are siloed; Globe readers probably don't read the Post and vice-versa.
Online, you must find niches and serve them deeply. Solution: hire MORE reporters to cover under-served niches.
And support niche-focused reporting with crowdsourced reporting and distribution--niche focus + decentralization = online success.

Some key takeaways from #GettingThingsDone: next actions must be physical, task context is essential, lists are key to mental liberation.
Random musing: people fear real freedom, and at least part of every impulse to live beyond means stems from a drive to minimize options.
Can't believe I only just discovered GetSatisfaction.com. Crowdsourced customer service. Promising. Anyone know who's behind it? Biz model?
Finally finishing up #GettingThingsDone and can say it's changed my life. Subtle, useful improvements. Will blog in detail soon.
Favorite quote from #GettingThingsDone: .f you're not sure why you're doing something, you can never do enough of it.
Wish I had a camera. Three Toronto paramedics just came into Starbucks with a guy on a stretcher. Walk up to the counter and order drinks.
Everyone's wondering what's up. People start taking pictures. Ask the supervisor. Turns out guy on stretcher is injured paramedic.
Apparently paralyzed. Requested that these guys bring him to Starbucks for a drink. They obliged.
Supervisor says: .eah, we don't usually bring patients to Starbucks..I thought it was some sort of mockumentary. But nope.
Now that's dedication--both to their comrade, and to Starbucks.

At talk by Alanna Mitchell for new book Sea Sick. Ocean makes up 71% of planet, has 90% of Earth's biomass and  99% of its living space.
Mitchell: carbon in atmosphere is altering ocean pH. Already has. A few more years of carbon, 25% of species die. Double carbon, 75% die.
Mitchell: .f all life on land died out, the oceans would be fine. If all life in the ocean died, we'd be dead tomorrow.
Mitchell sees some hope in China, where the government has recognized the problem and plans to address it--including the moral issues.
